## Inspiration
I was playing around with a paper airplane and I was looking for ideas that would be fun and memorable to do in this hackathon
## What it does
In CloudGliderVR you control a little plane with your right hand, and with the various obstacles that are around the map, you are encouraged to put your skills to the test and get better at piloting this airplane while getting around obstacles.
## How we built it
I used the 3d library Babylon js along with Fusion 360 for the obstacle to create most of the visuals.
The plane model is downloaded from the internet (user _printable_models_ on free3d.com).
I also extensively used the Cursor IDE with the heavy help of LLMs for the rapid prototyping that was necessary.
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge that I ran into was downsizing the scope of the project and changing its theming after some core mechanics that where essential to my main concept where unable to be achieved. Shooting and enemy AI was going to be a core mechanic where the overall theming of the project would be more Arcade with high-scores, but I simply couldn't do it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I chose to start this project as a solo developer with only 16 hours left in the Hackathon, and I am proud of how far I reached with that limited time. 
## What we learned
That when faced with the option between doing something that I wasn't passionate about or go with my own gut feeling, the latter option will be infinitely more rewarding.
## What's next for CloudGlider VR
Implementing the Arcade mode, possibly some showcases to my friends and clubs at Colgate University, and possibly a fork made for large scale projections and integrate it in an installation.
